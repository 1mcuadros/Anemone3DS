# Credits

The following people contributed to Anemone3DS in some way. Without these people, Anemone3DS wouldn't exist, or wouldn't be as good as it is:
 * Daedreth, who wrote the initial implementation of theme application code and SMDH parsing
 * LiquidFenrir, who refactored a lot of my messy GUI code and wrote the image preview from zip code, as well as the icon code
 * Sono, who wrote the BCSTM playback code
 * Kenn (mattkenster) for designing the GUI, a number of sprites used in the application, and drawing the banner and icon.

Special thanks go to these people who, while not directly contributing, helped immensely:
 * Rinnegatamante, whose code served as reference on theme installation.
 * BernardoGiordano for making pp2d, and being super responsive to feature requests and just general help
 * yellows8 for his home menu extdump tool, which was invaluable in debugging.
 * the folks on #dev of Nintendo Homebrew, who helped with unicode shenanigans (especially Stary2001, Fenrir, and DanielKO).
 * the maintainers for all used libraries, including ctrulib, zlib, citro3d, pp2d and minizip.
 * all the people who helped keep me going and motivated me to work. This includes, but is definitely not limited to:
   * The members of the Nintendo Homebrew Discord
   * The members of the Secret Shack Service Discord
   * The members of the ThemePlaza Discord
